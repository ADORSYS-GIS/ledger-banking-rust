### üéâ Stack Optimization: Replaced Vec with BoundedVec
This commit replaces `Vec<T>` with `BoundedVec<T, N>` across multiple crates to reduce heap allocations and improve memory efficiency.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduces heap allocations by favoring stack-based data structures.
- **Performance**: Improves performance by avoiding the overhead of heap management for small, fixed-size collections.
- **Workspace-Wide Impact**: The change was applied to domain models, mappers, and repositories for `Channel` and `Transaction`.
- **Code Health**: Aligns with the project's goal of optimizing for resource-constrained environments.

## Key Achievements (August 2025)

### üéâ Docs & Commands Refactoring: Streamlined Normalization
This commit streamlines the developer workflow by consolidating multiple normalization-related commands and documentation into a single, unified `normalize.md` command.
- **Simplified Workflow**: Replaced several outdated command files with a single, comprehensive command.
- **Removed Clutter**: Deleted obsolete documentation to reduce repository size and improve clarity.
- **Centralized Logic**: All normalization-related instructions are now in one place.

### üéâ Customer Domain Refactoring: Builder Pattern and Validation
This commit introduces a comprehensive refactoring of the Customer domain to improve ergonomics, validation, and auditability.
- **Builder Pattern**: Introduced `CustomerBuilder` for fluent and validated `Customer` creation, deprecating the legacy `Customer::new` function.
- **Enhanced Validation**: Centralized validation logic within the domain and service layers for improved data integrity.
- **Improved Auditability**: Shifted to `reason_id` for status changes, providing a clearer and more consistent audit trail.

### üéâ Performance Refactoring: Slice-Based APIs
This commit completes a significant performance-focused refactoring by replacing `Vec<T>` with `&[T]` in function signatures across the workspace.
- **Performance Boost**: Reduces unnecessary heap allocations and memory copies, leading to faster execution.
- **Ergonomic APIs**: Provides more flexible and idiomatic Rust APIs, allowing callers to pass arrays, `Vecs`, or slices.
- **Workspace-Wide Impact**: The change was applied to domain models, service layers, repositories, and mappers for consistency.
- **Code Health**: Improves overall code quality and maintainability by adhering to Rust best practices.

### üéâ Domain Model Refactoring and Type Cleanup
This commit introduces a major refactoring to remove ambiguous types and align domain models with the database schema.
- **Type Cleanup**: Replaced `heapless::String` with `std::string::String` across the workspace for improved clarity and maintainability.
- **Domain Model Refactoring**: Updated domain models to use nested structs instead of flattened fields, improving code clarity and consistency.
- **Schema Alignment**: Aligned the `daily_collection_mapper` with the updated `CollectionBatch` domain object, resolving a compilation error.
- **Code Consistency**: Ensured that all components now adhere to a standardized data model, improving consistency and reducing ambiguity.

### üéâ ID Normalization and Daily Collection Refactoring
This commit introduces a major refactoring to normalize ID references across the workspace and enhances the daily collection functionality.
- **ID Normalization**: Replaced `id: i32` with `id: Uuid` across all relevant domain models, repositories, and mappers for improved data integrity.
- **Schema Update**: The database schema (`001_initial_schema.sql`) was updated to use native `UUID` primary keys.
- **Daily Collection Enhancements**: The daily collection models, repositories, and mappers were refactored for better performance and consistency.
- **Code Consistency**: Ensured that all components now adhere to a standardized `Uuid`-based identifier system.

### üéâ Repository Refactoring and EOD Service Implementation
This update marks a significant milestone with the removal of simplified repository implementations and the completion of the End-of-Day (EOD) service.
- **Repository Refactoring**: Replaced simple `compliance` and `transaction` repositories with their full-featured counterparts, improving data integrity and feature completeness.
- **EOD Service Complete**: The `EodServiceImpl` is now fully implemented, enabling automated end-of-day processing.
- **Enhanced Testing**: Added over 30 new tests for repositories, ensuring robustness.

### üéâ Product Domain Refactoring and DB Schema Alignment
A major refactoring of the product, account, and fee domains to align with the new database schema.
- **New Features**: Introduced `AccountHold` to manage balance holds and a dedicated `ProductRepository` for data access.
- **Schema Alignment**: Updated `001_initial_schema.sql` to reflect the new, more robust schema.
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed significant amounts of outdated documentation and dead code.
