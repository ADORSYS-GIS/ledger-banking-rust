## Business Rules and Validation

### Collection Program Rules

Collection program validation ensures that all program parameters comply with regulatory requirements, business policies, and operational constraints. Minimum collection amounts must meet regulatory thresholds for cash transaction reporting while remaining accessible to target customer segments. Maximum collection amounts are constrained by agent cash handling limits, security considerations, and customer affordability assessments.

Program duration validation considers customer financial capacity, graduation pathway availability, and regulatory requirements for savings product transitions. Programs must include clear graduation criteria that enable customers to transition to traditional banking products when appropriate, supporting financial inclusion objectives and customer development goals.

Fee structure validation ensures that collection-related fees are transparent, reasonable, and compliant with consumer protection regulations. Fee calculations must consider collection frequency, agent costs, and competitive market conditions while maintaining program sustainability and customer affordability.

### Customer Eligibility and Enrollment

Customer eligibility validation includes comprehensive KYC verification, income assessment, and risk evaluation procedures. Customers must demonstrate sufficient and stable income to support committed collection amounts while meeting minimum age, identification, and residency requirements established by regulatory authorities.

Income verification procedures accommodate informal sector workers and small business owners who may lack traditional income documentation. Alternative verification methods include business observation, community references, and cash flow analysis that provide reasonable assurance of customer payment capacity.

Risk assessment considers customer location, occupation, income stability, and previous banking relationships to determine appropriate collection amounts and program terms. High-risk customers may require additional verification, reduced collection amounts, or enhanced monitoring procedures.

### Collection Operations Validation

Collection amount validation ensures that recorded collections comply with agreed program terms, customer capacity, and regulatory requirements. Collections exceeding agreed amounts require customer consent and additional authorization, while collections below minimum thresholds may trigger customer support interventions.

Schedule compliance validation monitors collection timing, frequency, and location adherence to ensure program integrity and customer service quality. Significant deviations from agreed schedules require documentation, customer notification, and potential program adjustments.

Location verification uses GPS tracking and agent reporting to confirm collection locations and ensure customer security and convenience. Location discrepancies trigger investigation procedures and potential security alerts.

### Agent Performance and Compliance

Agent performance validation includes collection rate monitoring, customer satisfaction tracking, and compliance score evaluation. Agents must maintain minimum performance standards across all metrics to continue collection activities and receive performance-based incentives.

Cash handling validation ensures that agents properly manage collected funds, maintain accurate records, and deposit collections according to established procedures. Cash discrepancies trigger investigation procedures and may result in agent suspension pending resolution.

Compliance monitoring includes license verification, training completion, and adherence to customer interaction standards. Agents must maintain current licenses, complete required training, and demonstrate appropriate customer service behaviors.
