3. Production deployment documentation
4. Monitoring and observability integration

## Conclusion

This is an exceptionally well-designed core banking system that demonstrates enterprise-grade architecture and comprehensive business domain understanding. The foundation is solid with complete domain models, service interfaces, and database schemas. The critical blocker is the incomplete database repository implementation layer, which represents about 2000 lines of implementation code needed to bridge the gap between the excellent architecture and a fully functional system.

The codebase shows no malicious patterns and follows Rust best practices throughout. Once the repository implementations are completed, this system will provide a robust foundation for multi-product banking operations with strong regulatory compliance capabilities.
